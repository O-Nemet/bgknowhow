The only JavaScript utilized is for Google Analytics and the Paypal donation button.<br>
Other than that everything is handled by HTML/CSS supported by PHP for dynamic user interaction. There are plans to utilize the Angular framework in the future, to decrease code clutter and increase UI/UX possibilities.

# Installation

There is no fancy build or pipeline setup needed, at the moment. The development files are mirrored via SFTP 1:1 and a connection to the MySQL DB is defined in the config directory. The database is not part of the source code, yet.
