These different compositions are meant to display proven setups to strive for, for the very end game (top 4 and above). In general one of the seven slots will be the 'flex' spot, used to cycle new minions during the tavern rounds. Therefore, your actual board will rarely be as perfect as these listed here. Of course as many minions as possible should be tripled (the exception being minions with Divine Shield or Venomous) and buffed with Reborn, Venomous, Divine Shield or Taunt.

If you got a build that buffs multiple minions via <a class='hoverimage' href='/bgstrategy/minion/?id=355'>Rock Rock</a>, <a class='hoverimage' href='/bgstrategy/minion/?id=432'>Nalaa the Redeemer</a>, or <a class='hoverimage' href='/bgstrategy/minion/?id=473'>Greymane's Champion'</a>, the ideal cards you should be looking for should have a special effect such as Cleave or Divine Shield. Alternatively look for unique effects like <a class='hoverimage' href='/bgstrategy/minion/?id=5'>Impulsive Trickster</a> or <a class='hoverimage' href='/bgstrategy/minion/?id=102'>Wildfire Elemental</a>. But in general, just buff any card. Don't roll for the ideal, it can cost you the game to desperately try to find them. You want to scale early, not later.

Also primary support units like <a class='hoverimage' href='/bgstrategy/minion/?id=109'>Brann</a> and <a class='hoverimage' href='/bgstrategy/minion/?id=347'>Tichondrius</a> will usually be tossed for the very last fights, but are sometimes displayed here when being integral to the setup. If one of your units is lacking, it is also often beneficial to replace it with a <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=208">Leeroy the Reckless</a> or a <a class='hoverimage' href='/bgstrategy/minion/?id=398'>Transmuted Bramblewitch</a>, before a deciding fight.
