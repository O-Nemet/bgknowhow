# bgjson
A data provider for Hearthstone Battlegrounds data.

Inspired by https://mtgjson.com, https://hearthstonejson.com and supported by data provided by https://develop.battle.net/documentation/hearthstone/game-data-apis and https://hearthstone.wiki.gg/wiki/

The files in the /output directory are examples, generated by the export.php script (data based on BG patch 31.6.2). The json-files contain all the different card objects and are needed to run the website.
