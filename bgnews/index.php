    <p>
        Mewwy did some theorycrafting and came up with different lines and strategies to strive for and try out during the first week. The <a href="/bgcomps/">endgame compositions</a> for all the different minion types have been updated, incorporating the minion changes after Patch 29.2.
        The meta is still fresh, so of course this is just a first pass, but should provide you with plenty ideas and directions to aim for. Additonal information on how to build and play these builds will follow in the near future.
        <br><br>
        Outdated information on other areas of this website will also be updated during the next couple of days, after the new meta has settled a bit. Additionally, we will add an indicator for cards which are only available in Duos as well as special strategy information for this new coop mode.
        <br><br>
        These compositions are brought to you by high-MMR player and <a href="https://metafy.gg/@mewwyhs" target="_blank">BG coach</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mewwyhs" target="_blank">Mewwy</a>.

    <p>
        Season 7 brings a massive rework of minions, over 50 new minions, as well as the new coop mode called Battlegrounds Duos. All the changes, including the Duos exclusive heroes, minions and spells, are documented in the <a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24077473/29-2-patch-notes" target="_blank">29.2 patch notes</a>.
        <br><br>
        Quests will be gone, at least for the next couple of months, but <a href="https://bgknowhow.com/bgstrategy/?show=spells">spells</a> were a huge success and are here to stay, with only some smaller adjustments.
        <br><br>

    <p>
        Blizzard has released the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/hearthstone/24064735/29-0-patch-notes" target="_blank">29.0 patch notes</a>, celebrating the 10-year Hearthstone anniversary. The Battlegrounds changes are minimal, but they reactivated the dual Naga/Pirate minion <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=267">Greta Gold-Gun</a>.
        <br><br>
        They also teased upcoming infos about the next major BG update (most likely hitting in the middle of April) which will include the BG Duos feature, first announced at Blizzcon in early November. Check out our <a href="#bgduos">old news post</a> if you would like to know more.
        <br><br>
        In other news, Jeef once again proved all the naysayers wrong, who argued that the quest meta is more luck based, by reaching the phenomenal milestone of 18,000 MMR. Check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWDZGJmxZ6A" target="_blank">YouTube video of his last game</a> (featuring a crazy Mech board) or the whole seven hour <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2087139017" target="_blank">Twitch stream</a>.

    <p>
        In a surprise move Blizzard deciced to spice up the BG season of spells by bringing back quests and rewards for everyone (starting on turn 4). Read all about it as well as the minion and spell updates in the <a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24056184/28-6-patch-notes" target="_blank">28.6.0 patch notes</a>. For a complete overview check out our listings of all active and inactive <a href="/bgstrategy/?show=quests">quests</a> and <a href="/bgstrategy/?show=rewards">rewards</a>.
        <br><br>
        The patch added 11 new rewards, 7 new minions, 3 new spells, 10 new minion type specific spells and also removed 14 minions from the pool (the most prominent victims being <a class='hoverimage' href='/bgstrategy/minion/?id=399'>Relentless Mur'ghoul</a> and <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=95">Octosari, Wrap God</a>), while returning 6 minions from past metas (for example <a class='hoverimage' href='/bgstrategy/hero/?id=211'>Mantid Queen</a> is back in the game!).
        <br><br>
        Looking ahead, it seems like the current season will run until the middle of April, so better get used to this new meta.

    <p>
        Blizzard has released the <a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24046220/28-4-1-patch-notes" target="_blank">Patch 28.4.1 notes</a> applying a few BG balance changes to Beasts, Undead, Quilboars, and Spells.
        <br><br>
        Also <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=434">Land Lubber</a> is back in the minion pool, but it got upped to Tier 3 in order to prevent the traditional lubbing strategies. Only time will tell if this was enough of a change or some clever players will come up with another reproducable strategy to lubb.

    <p>
        Blizzard has just removed the infamous <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=434">Land Lubber</a> in an emergency hotfix!
        And they even added an ingame popup to inform everyone about it (only in english clients), in order to prevent mass tears for staying on Tier 2 for too long.
        <br><br>
        Seems like they still do listen to the community after all, but sometimes are restrained by their internal schedules and communication. BG Lead Game Designer <a href="https://twitter.com/LoewenMitchell/status/1748487417236193517" target="_blank">Mitchell Loewen</a> stated that it will return "with some changes in the next hotfix", which will most likely drop before the end of the month.

        Blizzard has released the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/hearthstone/24046221/28-4-patch-notes" target="_blank">Patch 28.4 notes</a>. Unfortunately this time the Battlegrounds mode is merely a sidenote in the patch, as only the previously deactivated due to bugs minion <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=449">Paint Smudger</a> and the spell <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/spell/?id=21">Staff of Enrichment</a> will return to the game.
        <br><br>
        Many players were hoping for a nerf to the so-called lubbing strategy, which is based on the minion <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=434">Land Lubber</a> in combination with Elementals and Demons, and kinda skewed the metagame during the last couple of weeks.
        Influencer manager <a href="https://twitter.com/RidiculousHat" target="_blank">RidiculousHat</a> stated that testing for balance changes hasn't been possible yet, due to time constraints after the holiday season, but was positive that some changes may turn up before the end of the month.
        <br><br>
        So we will have to wait a bit longer, until boards like this will be a thing of the past:

    <p>
        Happy New Year, everyone! Back in June 2022, I started this website as a small side project because I was enjoying the Hearthstone Battlegrounds gameplay, and I noticed a kind of void regarding persistent strategic information. I wanted to provide the community, especially newer players, with a hub of knowledge and information (you can check out my <a href="/introduction.php">original mission statement</a> if you like). I also wanted to test and broaden my skill set, as well as experiment with new ways to structure and develop content.
        <br><br>
        Today, this website has about 250 unique visitors a day, and according to the engagement time, most users are enjoying and utilizing the content very well. Just last week, I did receive the first-ever PayPal donation, appreciating the time and effort I've put into this site so far. I want to tell that kind stranger and everyone else who supported me on this journey that I am very grateful, and it means a lot to me. With a full-time day job and a family to provide for, I am aware that the speed of adding content is slow compared to other pages, and some technical aspects are still lacking. That is one of the reasons I try to focus on evergreen content and information.
        <br><br>
        Anyway, my plans for this website for 2024 are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add missing texts and information (for example, the basic definitions)</li>
        <li>Reactivate the currently bugged Blizzard account login so everyone will be able to upvote/downvote the strategy posts once again.</li>
        <li>Streamline and fix mobile views</li>
        <li>Maybe find and motivate more people who have time and knowledge to contribute (shoutout to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MewwyHS" target="_blank">Mewwy</a>, TranRed, The Pink God, and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/PockyPlays/videos">PockyPlays</a> who already did so during the last year)</li>
        <li>Maybe write a Discord bot utilizing the BGJSON data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <br>
        I don't usually advertise this website, but if you know someone who could benefit, please spread the word and maybe add some strategy tips yourself. Or, if you are interested in writing down some knowledge or even adding some coding, contribute to <a href="https://github.com/O-Nemet/bgknowhow" target="_blank">this project on GitHub</a>. Also, if you happen to have ideas, for example, what type of content to add or how to further improve this website, please take the time to drop me a quick message at <a href="mailto:suggestions@bgknowhow.com">suggestions@bgknowhow.com</a> or on the <a href="https://discord.gg/RUsfdacMwA" target="_blank">Competitive BG Discord</a>.
        <br><br>
        Have a hopefully great and wonderful 2024, everyone!

    <p>
        Blizzard just released <a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24033779/28-2-3-patch-notes" target="_blank">Patch 28.2.3</a> onto the servers, bringing lots of adjustments to many minions and spells, as well as a couple of heroes. For example, after a huge nerf (every third Tavern spell now costing 1 gold less, instead of 0 gold total) <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/hero/?id=100">Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher</a> is allowed to rejoin the game.
        <br><br>
        For a quick overview on which cards got nerfed/buffed check out this infographic:

    <p>
        After hotfix <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/hearthstone/24008698/28-2-1-patch-notes" target="_blank">patch 28.2.1</a> last week did not bring any changes for BGs, today's hotfix <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/t/2822-patch-notes/" target="_blank">patch 28.2.2 </a> provides us with the first balancing changes in the form of hero armor adjustments. Many heroes received an armor increase, <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/hero/?id=27">Guff</a>, <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/hero/?id=53">Ragnaros</a> and <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/hero/?id=63">Sneed</a> even got buffed to the maximum amount of 20 armor. Whereas only three heroes <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/hero/?id=35">Lich Baz"hial</a>, <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/hero/?id=99">Snake Eyes</a> and <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/hero/?id=100">Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher</a> had their armor reduced.
        <br><br>
        Also, due to the increasing clever use of game mechanics regarding the hero power <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/hero/?id=100">Reliquary Research</a> (staying on Tier 2 and buying lots of <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/spell/?id=13">Strike Oil</a>), Blizzard felt forced to move and decided to deactivate the hero <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/hero/?id=100">Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher</a> until his hero power will get adjusted, most likely in another patch next Tuesday.
        <br><br>
        In other news we got confirmation that <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=329">Upbeat Duo</a>, while not listed in the minion purge lists before Season 6, was indeed intentionally removed and therefore will not come back in the near future.

        Blizzard released a second <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/t/2802-patch-notes/116446" target="_blank">hotfix</a> today, removing <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/anomaly/?id=36">Shackles of the Primus</a> and <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/anomaly/?id=47">Temperance of Aman'Thul</a> from the pool of active anomalies. In addition, they adjusted the appearance rates of a few other anomalies and updated some anomaly-related hero bans.
        <br><br>
        Also the stat buffing bugs regarding <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=319">Rylak</a> / <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=259">Felemental</a> and <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=121">Nomi</a> should be finally fixed now.

        Blizzard released <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/t/2801-patch-notes/115936" target="_blank">hotfix patch notes</a> including some updated bans for a number of anomalies.

        <br><br>
        They also fixed some bugs, including the
        <del>Evil</del>
        <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/anomaly/?id=56">Anomalous Twin</a> anomaly. So there is a high chance for some/most of the recently temporarily deactived anomalies to rejoin the fray.
        <br><br>
        Unfortunately the omnipresent stat buffing bugs regarding <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=319">Rylak</a> / <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=259">Felemental</a> and <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=121">Nomi</a> have not been fixed, yet.

        The patch notes come without any other gameplay changes for the BG mode, but Blizzard does state that until the start of the new BG season (in early December) there won't be any additional anomalies released. Besides that, from now on you are able to toggle any number of BG strikes and boards in your collection, in order to get a random one of your selection for each of your games.

    <p>
        Blizzard just revealed an upcoming two player coop mode for Battlegrounds, which will be released "early in 2024".<br>
        The official announcement can be found on the <a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24008691/introducing-battlegrounds-duos" target="_blank">Blizzard HS website</a> or you can view the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1967600933?t=2h32m19s" target="_blank">live on stream reveal</a> (90 seconds) or the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1967600933?t=7h14m54s" target="_blank">complete preview panel</a> (19 minutes).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each duo team will share a single HP/armor pool (HP will be 30, armor will be the combined hero armor values of both heroes)</li>
        <li>Each game will feature 4 different duo teams (it can be assumed that the top 2 teams will gain MMR, while the bottom 2 will lose some)</li>
        <li>The buy phase is pretty much the same, but you can check out your partners tavern and board anytime, by clicking on a new portal animation on the right side of your screen</li>
        <li>Each player will have to level their tavern tier up by themselves</li>
        <li>Any card in your hand can be sent to your partner for 1 gold each, by moving it onto the new portal animation</li>
        <li>New overlay effects for the tavern have been added, clearly indicating that a minion in your tavern could make a triple for your partner</li>
        <li>The starting player for the combat phase will alternate between you and your partner every turn (indicated by the order of the player panel on the left side of the screen)</li>
        <li>The board of player#2 will spawn in combat after the board of player#1 has been wiped completely (including effects like Deathrattle)</li>
        <li>There is no direct interaction between you or your teammates board during the combat (e.g. a <a class="hoverimage">Rot Hide Gnoll</a> on your partners board will not count minions which died while your board was active)</li>
        <li>If the board of player#1 is already enough to win against both boards of the enemy duo team, the empty slots on the board will be filled up with minions from player#2 after the combat has concluded (therefore increasing the damage the losing team takes)</li>
        <li>The duo mode will add at least 4 new mode-exclusive heroes:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cho'Gall</strong> featuring the HP "Double Trouble" (Passive. Whenever you play a Golden minion, both you and Gall get a triple reward). These are actually two heroes, but can only be played when picked together, so most likely only when queing up together with your teammate</li>
                <li><strong>Madam Goya</strong> featuring the HP "Efficient Exchange" (Pass a non-Golden minion.)</li>
                <li><strong>Flobbidinous Floop</strong> featuring the HP "Glorious Gloop" (Choose a friendly minion. Start of Combat: Transform it into your teammate's highest-Attack minion)</li>
                <li><strong>The Nameless One</strong> featuring the HP "" (Passive. Start of Game: Copy your teammate's Hero Power)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The duo mode will add at least 15 new mode-exclusive minions, featuring special abilites designed for the mode:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Passenger</strong> (Tier 1, Neutral) - Whenever your team Passes, gain +1/+1.</li>
                <li><strong>Morgl the Oracle</strong> (Tier 1, Murloc) - The first time this is Passed each turn, gain +3/+3.</li>
                <li><strong>Fortune-Hunter Flo</strong> (Tier 2, Neutral) - Battlecry: Your teammate gets a Gold Coin.</li>
                <li><strong>Gemcarver Blackthorn</strong> (Tier 2, Quilboar) - Deathrattle: You and your teammate get a Blood Gem.</li>
                <li><strong>Orc-estra Conductor</strong> (Tier 3, Neutral) - Battlecry: Give a minion +2/+1 (Upgraded for each Orc-estra Conductor your team has played.)</li>
                <li><strong>Plunder Pal</strong> (Tier 3, Pirate) - At the start of your turn, your teammate gains 1 Gold.</li>
                <li><strong>Long'xin</strong> (Tier 3, Dragon) - At the end of your turn, give your teammate's minions +1 Attack.</li>
                <li><strong>Archimonde</strong> (Tier 4, Demon) - Battlecry: Minions in your teammate's Tavern have +2/+2 for the rest of the game.</li>
                <li><strong>Avenging Ally</strong> (Tier 4, Undead) - Avenge (3): Your teammate gets a random Reborn or Deathrattle minion.</li>
                <li><strong>Friendly Freshwater</strong> (Tier 4, Elemental) - Deathrattle: Your teammate's next 3 Refreshes cost (0).</li>
                <li><strong>Cloning Cuddlgam</strong> (Tier 4, All) - When you buy or Discover this, your teammate also gets a copy.</li>
                <li><strong>Electron</strong> (Tier 5, Mech) - At the end of your turn, give a minion in your teammate's warband Divine Shield.</li>
                <li><strong>Benefactor</strong> (Tier 5, Naga) - Spellcraft: Pass a different non-Golden minion.</li>

        </li>
        <li>An icon-based ping system for minions and buttons (freeze, level, etc.) has been added to enable voiceless communication options between teammates. The icons available are a question mark, a green check, a red x and a portal symbol</li>
        <li>There will be seperate queues for traditional BG single player and BG duo teams (with the additional option to also join alone and get teamed up by the system)</li>
        <li>There seems to be a permanent damage cap of 15 at the moment</li>
        <li>Deadguy fight handling seems to be bugged at the moment, as you can fight a duo team again, right after killing it</li>

    <p>
        Observant players have reported that the Blizzard launcher lists the current BG season pass available until the 4th of December. This is a pretty decent indicator that the next BG season will start on December 5th. At the moment it is still unknown if that season will start in vanilla mode or with the return of the Buddy-, the Prize- or the Quest-system. What is certain though is that everyone's MMR rating will be reset to 0 (your hidden MMR will still be there though) and you will have to purchase a new Battle Pass if you want to be able to select more than two heroes at the start of each match.
