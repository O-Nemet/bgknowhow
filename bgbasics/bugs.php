    <p>
        Here is a list of currently known/active bugs with gameplay impact in Hearthstone Battlegrounds:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Giving a Magnetic mech in the shop Taunt, and then Magnetizing it, the Taunt won't apply to <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=353">Polarizing Beatboxer</a>. Also, temporary stat buffs on Magnetic minions will no longer be applied to the Beatboxer, too.</li>
        <li>Some deathratlle effects (like <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=208">Leeroy</a>) will not be transfered to the Fish of <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/hero/?id=45">N'Zoth</a>.</li>
        <li><a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/spell/?id=30">Planar Telescope</a> gives nothing if your most common type is not one of the minion types in the game and you're not at Tier 6 (where there is an "All" type minion).</li>
        <li>When you have multiple <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=475">Timecap'n Hooktail</a> on your board, minions with buff effects triggered by it (like <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=42">Whelp Smuggler</a> or <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=535">Defiant Shipwright</a>) will not proc for each instance, but only once.</li>
        <li>All abilites on golden Zilliax modules (like <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=475">Whirring</a> or <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=507">Bonding</a>), when generated by other means than trippling, will not work.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Duos: The Buddy Button can't be pinged.</li>

        <li>Duos: The quest indicator for the hero power of <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/hero/?id=87">Sire Denathrius</a> will be hidden on your screen, making it harder to track your quest progress (your teammate can see it though).</li>
        <li>Duos: The hero power of <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/hero/?id=64">Tamsin Roame</a> has a chance to consume two minions instead of one.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>
