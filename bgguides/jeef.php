<h2 class="page_title">Jeef's guides and tierlists</h2>
<p>
    For many seasons of Battlegrounds US-based streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jeefhs" target="_blank">Jeef</a> has proven to be one of the best if not the best player in the game. At the end of BG Season 6 he began publishing a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSlzd9R10rNw4rK-7pKDwz2QXUjiOyQpozmukDS31AGoj-pc_rpb_kgYxk0JkdoHJApeU0GYypM6p-D/pubhtml" target="_blank">composition tier list</a>, ranking the different endgame builds by strength and difficulty to play. This list has been regulary updated by him, ever since.
    <br><br>
    Every comp features a link listing the common enablers, when to commit to it, how to play it (most of them even featuring an example-run video), as well as possible addons to your board.
