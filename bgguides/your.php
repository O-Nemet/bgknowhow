    If you have written or are writing a guide that should be featured on this page, just contact me on Discord or drop me a <a href="mailto:guides@bgknowhow.com">mail</a>. Please notice that guides which tackle general strategy often last much longer than those which are too specific and will most likely get outdated by the very next patch.
