<h2 class="page_title">Curve Theory</h2>
<br>
<div>
    <p>
        When to level to the next tavern tier and when to buy minions or utilize your hero power instead, is a whole lot of theory on its own and greatly depends on the hero you are playing and also on the cost of its hero power.<br><br>
        The standard/basic curve is going to level 2 on turn 2 (4 gold), going to level 3 on turn 5 (7 gold) and going to level 4 on turn 7 (9 gold). After that, deciding to level to 5 or 6 will heavily depend on your board, which discover you get from your first triple, and even your opponents board.
