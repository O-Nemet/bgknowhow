<h2 class="page_title">Curve Theory</h2>
<br>
<div>
    <p>
        When to level to the next tavern tier and when to buy minions or utilize your hero power instead, is a whole lot of theory on its own and greatly depends on the hero you are playing and also on the cost to use its hero power.
        <br><br>
        The standard/basic curve is buying one minion on turn 1 (3 gold), going to level 2 on turn 2 (4 gold), selling your minion to buy two minions on turn 3 (5 gold), buying two minions on turn 4 (6 gold), buying one minion and going to level 3 on turn 5 (7 gold), rolling and buying the best two minions on turn 6 (8 gold), and going to level 4 on turn 7 (9 gold). After that, deciding to level to 5 or 6 will heavily depend on your board, which discover you get from your first triple, and even your opponents boards.
        <br><br>
        If you happen to get an early minion that can generate gold value for you (the most prominent example being <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=2">Deck Swabbie</a><!--<a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=14">Sellemental</a> and <a class="hoverimage" href="/bgstrategy/minion/?id=193">Shell Collector</a>-->) you can either gain some tempo by buying two minions without having to sell one on turn 3 (5 gold) or alter your curve aggressively to level earlier (for example going to level 3 on turn 3 (5 gold) without having to sell your minion).
        <br><br>
        If your hero power activation costs 1 gold and is worthwhile early on you can alternatively play the so-called Rafaam curve going to level 2 on turn 4 (6 gold), going to level 3 on turn 6 (8 gold) and going to level 4 on turn 7 (9 gold).
        <br><br>
        For further information about the different kind of curves and which hero prefers which, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J_NuzXHEsppgrAWJzLEZwESfiiNyURo3pCBAO1ga2mE/" target="_blank">Battlegrounds Curvesheet by Minder and Jkirek</a>.
        <br><br>
        Please note: In the currently active spell meta of season 7, following a curve plan per hero is not as important as before. The spells offered can often smoothen your turns in the early- and mid-game. Due to that the curve sheet is currently on hiatus, but the basic principles can still be applied to your games.
